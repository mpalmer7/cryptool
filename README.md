# cryptool
An identification and decryption tool for ciphers.

Run "cryptool.py" <br />
For example: <br />
> python cryptool.py -s "Khoor Zruog" <br />
> python cryptool.py -f textfile.txt <br />

If you know what cipher you are decrypting, that can also be specified with a flag.

Otherwise, it will try to guess what kind of cipher it is.
